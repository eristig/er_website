The goal of these modules is to provide an overview of the general concepts of YPR and SPR and how they can be used in fishery management. It is not designed to be an exhaustive description of YPR and SPR. Rather, it is aimed at audiences who lack formal fisheries science training, but are interested in better understanding the complicated fisheries concepts of YPR and SPR.\nThe nine learning modules cover the topics of Yield-per-recruit; Spawning Potential Ratio; Growth overfishing; Recruitment overfishing; Life history information; Size limits; Setting size limits; Multi-species size limits; and Length frequencies.\n\n\n\n",

Many of these species are at high risk of extinction with approximately one-quarter of sharks and rays categorized as threatened according to the IUCN Red List. Mozambique is a global hotspot for shark and ray species richness, endemism, and evolutionary distinctiveness. Chondrichthyes face many threats in Mozambique, especially from fishers, as up to 60% of the population is in some way dependent on marine resources for either sustenance or employment. Marine protected areas (MPAs) may be an effective conservation strategy for sharks and rays if carefully planned. Here, we develop a spatial prioritization model that identifies key areas for shark and ray conservation within the Mozambique economic exclusive zone (EEZ). This is an intermediate step in an ongoing MPA planning process currently underway in Mozambique. Our model will be used by Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the Mozambique government to ensure shark and ray protection is considered in the overall MPA network design.\nFull Thesis\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nSize limit report prepared for Ka‘ūpūlehu Marine Life Advisory Committee\nCo-authored a report containing an analysis of size limit options for 33 reef-associated fish species that was conducted in support of continued development of management measures at Ka‘ūpūlehu Marine Reserve, Hawaiʻi Island. The effects of species-specific size limits were analyzed in terms of optimization of fishing yield and protection of spawning biomass. This analysis was constructed from the perspective that reaching spawning size prior to becoming vulnerable to fishing is a relevant consideration for ensuring long-term sustainability of fish populations. Thus, size limit options were explored relative to size at maturity. Accordingly, the analysis was intended to guide decision-making in relation to yield and spawning biomass objectives, and to support on-going community-led discussions about preference, feasibility, and pragmatism of size limits as management measures within the Kaʻūpūlehu Comprehensive Management Plan.\nFull Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
