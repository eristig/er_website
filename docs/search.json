I’m a Masters student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management (UCSB). I am studying marine resources management with a focus on data science and fisheries management. My background is in international development, community-driven conservation, and data management implementation. I am interested in the development of models and tools for improved community-driven management of marine resources. I have experience working in Ecuador, Argentina, Mexico, Mozambique, Brazil, and Portugal and hope to continue working internationally on fisheries management projects.\n            \n            \n              Hello!
