#### Abstract
Chondrichthyes, a class of marine cartilaginous fish (sharks, rays, skates, and chimaeras), are important predators in pelagic, coastal, and estuarine food webs. Many of these species are at high risk of extinction with approximately one-quarter of sharks and rays categorized as threatened according to the IUCN Red List. Mozambique is a global hotspot for shark and ray species richness, endemism, and evolutionary distinctiveness. Chondrichthyes face many threats in Mozambique, especially from fishers, as up to 60% of the population is in some way dependent on marine resources for either sustenance or employment. Marine protected areas (MPAs) may be an effective conservation strategy for sharks and rays if carefully planned. Here, we develop a spatial prioritization model that identifies key areas for shark and ray conservation within the Mozambique economic exclusive zone (EEZ). This is an intermediate step in an ongoing MPA planning process currently underway in Mozambique. Our model will be used by Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the Mozambique government to ensure shark and ray protection is considered in the overall MPA network design.
