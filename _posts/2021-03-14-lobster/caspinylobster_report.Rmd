#### **INTRODUCTION**

This report looks at California Spiny Lobster (*Panulirus interruptus*, Figure 1) abundance and size along the Santa Barbara coast from 2012 - 2018. The spiny lobster is found in giant kelp forests in Southern California and is an important predator in these ecosystems. Spiny lobsters are also a prized target for both commercial and recreational fishermen and divers in the area. The data for this report comes from five long term kelp forest study sites along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. Two of these sites are within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that were established on January 1, 2012; the other three sites are not within MPAs. It is prohibited to take spiny lobsters within the two marine protected areas - Naples Reef and Isla Vista Reef. By looking at time-series data over a seven year period, we will analyze if and how lobster abundance and size changed over time within MPAs as compared to reefs that are not protected.

#### **DATA AND METHODS**

The data comes from Santa Barbara Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER), a research program based at the University of California, Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute. Data was collected beginning in 2012 by divers within five long term kelp forest study sites (Figure 2). Sampling on lobster size and abundance was taken annually in late summer prior to the start of fishing season at Naples, Isla Vista, Arroyo Quemado, Mohawk, and Carpinteria reefs. The variables studied in this report are lobster size, abundance, and protected status. Non-paired t-tests were performed, with an alpha of 0.025 used to indicate statistical significance; Cohenâ€™s d was calculated to measure effect size. The software used for this analysis was RStudio Version 1.2.1335.

**Figure 3.** California Spiny Lobster count from 2012 to 2018 at two MPA sites (Isla Vista and Naples) and three non-MPA sites (Mohawk, Carpinteria, and Arroyo Quemado).

In 2012, lobster abundance was similar across all five sites. (Figure 3). At the two MPA reefs, there was a general upward trend of lobster abundance from 2012-2018. Lobster abundance at Isla Vista Reef showed the greatest increase over time.

**Figure 4.** California Spiny Lobster size distribtions (in mm) in 2012 and 2018 at two MPA sites (Isla Vista and Naples) and three non-MPA sites (Mohawk, Carpinteria, and Arroyo Quemado).

At Naples and Isla Vista reefs, community size structure distributions shifted, with higher upper limits in 2018 (Figure 4). Distrubution of community size structure at Mohawk decreased over the time period.

#### Are observations paired or unpaired?

# Alternative hypothesis: The mean lobster size is NOT the same in MPA and non-MPA sites for 2012 observations.

# Null hypothesis: The mean lobster size is the same in MPA and non-MPA sites for 2018 observations.

# Alternative hypothesis: The mean lobster size is NOT the same in MPA and non-MPA sites for 2018 observations.

# When comparing MPA and non-MPA sites, our observations were grouped. We are not comparing transects at each reef, because lobsters move. The transects are a relative measurement, and don't tell us anything about lobster distribution across reefs.

# We're not comparing individual lobsters over time. So, our t-test will be unpaired.

```
The 2012 and 2018 sample sizes differed, with the 2012 sample being smaller than 2018 for both MPA and non-MPA sites (Figure 5). Because of this, we placed greater analytical value on the difference between the means and effect size to understand the impact of marine protected status on lobster size than the *p* value.

<br>

##### Mean lobster size between MPA and non-MPA sites in 2012.

Mean lobster size at MPAs was `r round(-difference_2012, 1)`mm smaller than mean lobster size at non-MPA sites in 2012. Mean lobster size (mm) at MPA reefs (`r round(mean_mpa_12, 1)` mm, SD = `r round(sd_mpa_12, 2)`, n = `r n_mpa_12`) differed significantly from mean lobster size at non-MPA reefs (`r round(mean_non_12, 1)` mm, SD = `r round(sd_non_12, 2)`, n = `r n_non_12`) by a non-paired two-sample t-test (t(`r round(size_test_2012$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(-size_test_2012$statistic, 2)`, *p* < 0.025). There is a moderate effect size (d = `r round(d_2012$estimate, 2)`) for lobster size in MPA vs. non-MPA reefs for 2012.

<br>

##### Mean lobster size between MPA and non-MPA sites in 2018.

Mean lobster size at MPAs was `r round(difference_2018, 1)`mm larger than mean lobster size at non-MPA sites in 2018. Mean lobster size (mm) at MPA reefs (`r round(mean_mpa_18, 1)` mm, SD = `r round(sd_mpa_18, 2)`, n = `r n_mpa_18`) differed significantly from mean lobster size at non-MPA reefs (`r round(mean_non_18, 1)` mm, SD = `r round(sd_non_18, 2)`, n = `r n_non_18`) by a non-paired two-sample t-test (t(`r round(size_test_2018$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(size_test_2018$statistic, 2)`, *p* < 0.025). There is a small effect size (d = `r round(-d_2018$estimate, 2)`) for lobster size in MPA vs. non-MPA reefs for 2018.

<br>

##### Mean lobster size in MPA sites between 2012 and 2018.

Mean lobster size at MPA reefs was `r round(-difference_mpas, 1)`mm larger in 2018 than in 2012. Mean lobster size (mm) at MPA reefs in 2012 (`r round(mean_mpa_12, 1)` mm, SD = `r round(sd_mpa_12, 2)`, n = `r n_mpa_12`) differed significantly from mean lobster size at MPA reefs in 2018 (`r round(mean_mpa_18, 1)` mm, SD = `r round(sd_mpa_18, 2)`, n = `r n_mpa_18`) by a non-paired two-sample t-test (t(`r round(size_test_mpa$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(-size_test_mpa$statistic, 2)`, *p* < 0.025). There is a large effect size (d = `r round(-d_mpa$estimate, 2)`) for lobster size within MPA reefs in 2012 vs. 2018.

<br>

##### Mean lobster size in non-MPA sites between 2012 and 2018.

Mean lobster size at non-MPA reefs was `r round(difference_non, 1)`mm smaller in 2018 than in 2012. Mean lobster size (mm) at non-MPA reefs in 2012 (`r round(mean_non_12, 1)` mm, SD = `r round(sd_non_12, 2)`, n = `r n_non_12`) did not differ significantly from mean lobster size at non-MPA reefs in 2018 (`r round(mean_non_18, 1)` mm, SD = `r round(sd_non_18, 2)`, n = `r n_non_18`) by a non-paired two-sample t-test (t(`r round(size_test_non$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(size_test_non$statistic, 2)`, *p* > 0.025). There is a negligible effect size (d = `r round(d_non$estimate, 2)`) for lobster size within non-MPA reefs in 2012 vs. 2018.

<br>
<br>

#### SUMMARY

- The two MPA reefs (Naples and Isla Vista) showed an increase in both lobster abundance (Figure 3) and lobster community size structure distribution (Figure 4) between 2012 and 2018.
- There was a statistically significant increase in mean lobster size (with a large effect size) within the MPA reefs in 2018 as compared to 2012. This demonstrates that closing these reefs to fishing had a positive effect on the Spiny lobster population size.
- Similarly, in 2018 mean lobster size at MPA reefs was statistically significantly larger (although with a small effect size) than mean lobster size at non-MPA reefs in 2018.
- There was no statistically significant difference found at non-MPA reefs when comparing lobster size between 2012 and 2018. This shows that keeping the reef open to fishing, or a "business-as-usual" scenario, did not effect lobster size.
